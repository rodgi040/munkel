/**
 * Shared message character limit — mirrors macOS `MessageLimits.maxCharacters`
 * (`apps/macos/Sources/MunkelApp/MessageLimits.swift`). This lives in
 * `@munkel/shared-wire` (not `apps/windows/src/shared`) so it is the single
 * source of truth for every workspace package that needs it, without any
 * package importing across another app's package boundary:
 * `apps/cli/src/munkel.ts` imports `MAX_MESSAGE_CHARS` from here instead of
 * keeping its own local constant, and `apps/windows` (composer inputs via
 * `MenuWindow.tsx` / `NotchWidget.tsx`, incoming-text display clamp in
 * `group-session.ts`) imports the same copy instead of forking the constant
 * per bundle. This module has no electron/DOM/Node dependency of its own, so
 * it is safe for the CLI (Bun, no Electron) and the renderer/main bundles
 * (Electron) alike.
 *
 * The macOS reference applies the cap symmetrically: outgoing text is
 * clamped before sending and incoming text is clamped before display, so
 * neither a local typo nor a peer can produce an oversized message in the
 * UI. Windows mirrors the *display* half of that (composer inputs +
 * incoming notch/menu text) — see `group-session.ts` for where incoming
 * chat/image-caption text is clamped, and `MenuWindow.tsx` /
 * `NotchWidget.tsx` for the composer/reply-field enforcement. Windows
 * deliberately does NOT also clamp outgoing text at the `GroupSession`
 * session layer (unlike macOS's `GroupSession.swift`): that layer already
 * has its own byte-based ~48 KiB wire-payload cap (`assertPayloadFits`)
 * that *rejects* an over-cap send with a "too long" error for any caller
 * bypassing the UI (e.g. a future CLI-driven send over the control
 * server) — silently truncating there instead would change that existing,
 * tested behavior from a visible error into silent data loss.
 *
 * `./wire-constants.ts` re-exports this same constant as `MAX_CHAT_CHARS`,
 * and `./payload.ts`'s `encodeChat` clamps outgoing chat text with
 * `clampMessageText` below — not a raw `.slice()`. Both existed historically
 * as separate constants, `MAX_CHAT_CHARS` counting UTF-16 code units via
 * `String.prototype.slice`; that let a long-enough emoji/ZWJ message pass
 * the UI's grapheme-based check and then get silently mis-truncated (and
 * potentially left with a lone surrogate) on the wire (#51). `MAX_CHAT_CHARS`
 * is now a plain alias of `MAX_MESSAGE_CHARS` — same cap, same unit — so the
 * two names can no longer drift apart.

/**
 * Trims `text` to the character cap, mirroring `MessageLimits.clamp` on macOS.
 *
 * macOS counts Swift `String` length in *extended grapheme clusters*
 * (`text.count` / `text.prefix`), so an emoji, ZWJ sequence (e.g. a family
 * emoji), flag, or skin-tone modifier counts as one character and is never
 * split. A naive UTF-16 `String.slice(0, 2048)` would count code units
 * instead and could sever a surrogate pair or ZWJ cluster mid-way, leaving a
 * lone surrogate / broken glyph. This clamp mirrors macOS by segmenting into
 * grapheme clusters via `Intl.Segmenter` (available in Electron's Chromium
 * runtime and in Bun's test runtime) and cutting on a cluster boundary.
