# Munkel

## Windows installation

**Recommended:** download `Munkel-Setup-<version>.exe` from CI artifacts or releases, run the installer, and open **Munkel** from the Start Menu or Windows Search. The installer creates Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts automatically — no manual configuration.

**Alternative (portable):** download the Windows zip artifact, extract it, and run `Munkel.exe` directly.

Fork beta builds are currently unsigned and do not verify publisher identity
on update — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Windows SmartScreen or Defender
may show an "Unknown publisher" warning on first install; click `More info`
and then `Run anyway`. Auto-updates still check integrity against the GitHub
Releases feed, but they do not prove the installer came from a signed
publisher ([#60](https://github.com/rodgi040/munkel/issues/60)).

Ephemeral messages between friends at the same café table, or across the
world, that slide out of the MacBook notch.

No accounts, no history, no message storage: a channel is born from a shared
human-readable code (`blue-table-42`). The app derives the relay group ID and
message key on-device; the relay routes encrypted payloads and does not receive
the plaintext code.

Website: **[munkel.app](https://munkel.app)**

## Quick start

1. Install the app and CLI: `brew install limehq/tap/munkel`, then `open -a Munkel`.
2. Sign in with GitHub (or just pick a display name) from the menu-bar icon.
3. Create or join a channel with a shared, spoken code like `blue-table-42`.
4. Send a message — to the whole channel or one member:
   - From the app: type in the menu-bar popover.
   - From the terminal: `munkel blue-table-42 all "coffee?"`
5. Incoming messages slide out of each recipient's MacBook notch (a floating
   panel on Macs without a notch).

Full install options (direct download, from source) are in
[Install](#install); how it all works is in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Install

**Homebrew** (app plus the `munkel` CLI):

```sh
brew install limehq/tap/munkel
open -a Munkel
```

The cask installs `Munkel.app` and symlinks the bundled `munkel` CLI onto your
`PATH`.

**Direct download** (app only): grab `Munkel-<version>.dmg` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/limehq/munkel/releases/latest) and drag
`Munkel.app` into Applications. The `munkel` CLI ships inside the app. To put it
on your `PATH`, open Munkel and choose **Install Command Line Tool…** from the
menu-bar gear menu — an item that shows only while the CLI isn't already on your
`PATH`. It links into the first writable directory on your `PATH`
(e.g. Homebrew's `bin`) with no admin password, or falls back to `~/.local/bin`
and adds it to `~/.zshrc` when Homebrew is absent (reopen your terminal
afterward). Either way the CLI needs the running app, which it talks to over a
socket.

Munkel keeps itself up to date via [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org): it
checks in the background and installs notarized updates in place. Trigger a
check or turn automatic checks on/off anytime from the menu-bar gear menu
(**Check for Updates…**); the Homebrew cask is `auto_updates true`, so `brew
upgrade` defers to Sparkle.

Or build locally from source:

```sh
bun install
bun run build
open apps/macos/.build/Munkel.app
```

The Windows client can be built from the integration branch with
`bunx turbo build --filter=@munkel/windows`; see `apps/windows/README.md` for
dev mode. It currently supports text chat, image albums, and the `munkel` CLI
over a named pipe.

## Components

Bun workspaces + [Turborepo](https://turborepo.dev):

| Path | Tech |
|---|---|
| `apps/macos/` | Swift menu-bar app: `MunkelKit` (crypto, protocol, relay client, GitHub login) + MenuBarExtra UI + notch display |
| `apps/windows/` | Electron Windows client: TypeScript core + React UI shell (text chat, image albums, named-pipe CLI) |
| `apps/cli/` | `munkel` CLI (Bun/TypeScript; Unix domain socket on macOS, named pipe on Windows) |
| `apps/server/` | Relay: Cloudflare Workers + **Durable Objects** (Hono + partyserver, TypeScript) |
| `apps/landing/` | Landing page: TanStack Start (React) on Cloudflare Workers, [munkel.app](https://munkel.app) |
| `skills/` | Agent skills (`SKILL.md`), installable via the [skills CLI](https://skills.sh) |

The wire protocol v1 (WebSocket + JSON, E2E AES-256-GCM) is specified in
`packages/shared-wire/PROTOCOL.md` and enforced by `@munkel/shared-wire`.

Production relay: **wss://relay.munkel.app** (the app's default).

## Security model

Munkel is designed for lightweight, ephemeral messages, not high-risk secret
sharing.

- The relay stores no messages and only sees derived group IDs, member IDs,
  message sizes, and timing.
- Message payloads are AES-256-GCM encrypted with a key derived from the channel
  code on-device.
- Generated channel codes are optimized for being spoken at a table. Treat them
  as convenience-grade secrets until the invite format is hardened; for more
  sensitive use, join with a longer custom code instead of a generated one.
- Direct messages are relay-targeted in v1, not pairwise encrypted. Any current
  channel member with the channel code shares the same message key.
- GitHub login is display identity only. It imports a name/avatar but does not
  prove to peers that a member controls a GitHub account.

Please report vulnerabilities through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Development

One-time setup: [Bun](https://bun.sh) and Xcode command line tools, then
`bun install` at the repo root. Everything runs from the root:

```sh
bun run test         # all packages: Swift Kit tests, CLI, server unit + e2e
bun run build        # all builds
bun run typecheck
```

Starting the individual apps:

| App | Command |
|---|---|
| Relay | `bunx turbo dev --filter=@munkel/server` → `ws://127.0.0.1:8787` |
| Landing | `bunx turbo dev --filter=@munkel/landing` → `http://localhost:3000` |
| macOS app | `cd apps/macos && bun run dev` (builds & runs **Munkel Dev**, see below) |
| Windows app | `bunx turbo dev --filter=@munkel/windows` |
| CLI | `bunx turbo build --filter=@munkel/cli`, then `apps/cli/dist/munkel` |

`bun run dev` builds and runs the **Munkel Dev** variant: a separate identity
(bundle id `dev.uq.munkel.debug`, with its own settings, control socket, and
menu-bar icon) that runs side by side with an installed release without
colliding. It launches the freshly built binary directly rather than via `open`,
so it always loads the new build and inherits your shell environment, and it
kills only the previous Munkel Dev instance, never your release. The root `bun
dev` excludes the macOS app, which needs the Swift toolchain; run the per-app
command above for it.

To drive the Munkel Dev app from the CLI, run it from source with `MUNKEL_DEV=1`,
which points it at the dev app's socket and bundle id:

```sh
MUNKEL_DEV=1 bun apps/cli/src/munkel.ts channels
```

The dev build deliberately does **not** embed the CLI (so it stays lean), so the
"Install Command Line Tool…" menu item is release-only.

The app talks to the production relay `wss://relay.munkel.app` by default. To
point a dev build at the local relay, set `MUNKEL_RELAY_URL` for that run:

```sh
MUNKEL_RELAY_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8787 bun run dev
```

`MUNKEL_RELAY_URL` is read once at launch and never persisted, so a plain `bun
run dev` falls straight back to the default. (For an installed app launched from
Finder, where env vars don't propagate, set it persistently instead with
`defaults write dev.uq.munkel relayURL ws://127.0.0.1:8787`, and `defaults
delete dev.uq.munkel relayURL` to restore the default.)

Watching the notch react without a second machine: with the relay and app
running and the app joined to a channel, `scripts/simulate-whispers.sh` joins
that channel as a second member and whispers you a message every 30 s. Handy
for demoing or iterating on the notch UI.

```sh
scripts/simulate-whispers.sh                    # blue-table-42, every 30 s
INTERVAL=10 scripts/simulate-whispers.sh kaffee-12 Mara
```

It sends a direct whisper to your installation `memberId` (read from the app's
UserDefaults), falling back to a channel broadcast. Override via
`RELAY_URL` / `CHANNEL` / `SENDER` / `INTERVAL` / `TO`. Under the hood it loops
`apps/server/scripts/dev-send.ts`, the protocol reference sender.

Deploys run automatically: CI ships the relay (`deploy-server.yml`) and the
landing (`deploy-landing.yml`) on pushes to `main` that touch their
`apps/<name>/**` paths, authenticating with the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` /
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` GitHub secrets (the `limehq` account). The R2 binding,
the cron trigger, and the `relay.munkel.app` custom domain all apply from
`wrangler.toml` on deploy — no manual step. To deploy by hand instead (needs a
`wrangler login` with access to `limehq`):

```sh
bunx turbo deploy --filter=@munkel/server    # relay.munkel.app
bunx turbo deploy --filter=@munkel/landing   # munkel.app
```

**One-time R2 setup (relay only).** The relay binds an R2 bucket for image
blobs (`munkel-blobs`, see `apps/server/wrangler.toml`). `wrangler deploy` does
*not* create it — create it once before the first deploy that includes the
binding, or the deploy fails with a missing-bucket error:

```sh
cd apps/server && bunx wrangler r2 bucket create munkel-blobs
```

The deploy token (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`) must also carry **Workers R2 Storage:
Edit**, on top of the Workers Scripts / Durable Objects scopes the text relay
already needed — without it the deploy is rejected. Blobs are opaque ciphertext
with a ~66 s logical TTL; the per-minute cron sweeps expired ones (`src/blob.ts`).

## Architecture decisions

- **Server-first transport**: one WebSocket relay path for both café and
  remote, with no flaky local P2P to break.
- **One Durable Object per channel** (`idFromName(groupId)`), WebSocket
  Hibernation API, no DO storage → ephemerality is enforced by design.
- **Notch-first interaction**: incoming messages appear in the notch, can be
  expanded, copied, and answered inline without opening a chat window.
- **UI/UX first**: the notch presentation is the product. PoC before plumbing.
- **Capture-proof surfaces**: every window showing message content or channel
  codes (notch panel, menu popover) is excluded from screen capture
  (`NSWindow.sharingType = .none`, applied frame-exactly by the
  `CaptureExclusion` view): invisible in Teams/Zoom shares and screenshots,
  visible on the physical display. Corollary: no `.help()` tooltips in notch
  content, since tooltips get their own capturable window.

## Relay server

Cloudflare Worker (Hono router) + one Durable Object per channel
([partyserver](https://github.com/cloudflare/partyserver) with WebSocket
hibernation). Modeled after the conventions in `wokkytokky/apps/server`.

The Worker is named `munkel-relay` and is reachable both as
`munkel-relay.limehq.workers.dev` and via the custom domain
**relay.munkel.app** (attached automatically on deploy through the
`routes` entry in `wrangler.toml`).

Connect with `GET /ws?group=<32-hex>&member=<uuid>`; see
`packages/shared-wire/src/protocol.ts`.

## Landing page

`apps/landing/` is a [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) (React +
Tailwind v4) app served by a Cloudflare Worker with SSR.

Deployment is plain `wrangler deploy`: the Worker is named `munkel` and the
custom domains **munkel.app** and **www.munkel.app** are declared as
`routes` with `custom_domain: true` in `apps/landing/wrangler.jsonc`, so
Cloudflare creates/updates the DNS records of the `munkel.app` zone
automatically on every deploy, with no manual DNS steps.

## macOS app

Menu bar icon → sign in with GitHub, create or join a channel, send to the
channel or a single member. Incoming messages appear in the notch via the app's
own `NotchPanel` component: hovering keeps the message open, the copy button
puts the text on the clipboard, inline reply can answer the sender or the
channel, and on Macs without a notch a floating panel is used automatically.
Settings live under the `dev.uq.munkel` defaults domain; the relay URL
defaults to the deployed Worker (override with `ws://127.0.0.1:8787` for
local development against `wrangler dev`).

### Login with GitHub

"Sign in with GitHub" in the menu imports your GitHub username and avatar as
your identity, still no account: the app runs the [OAuth device
flow](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow)
(user code is auto-copied, browser opens), requests a token with **empty
scope**, fetches `GET /user` once, downloads the avatar, and **discards the
token**. Stored locally: login name + a ≤20 KiB JPEG. The avatar travels to
peers only inside the E2E-encrypted `profile` payload; receivers never
contact GitHub, and the relay sees nothing.

Honest limits: GitHub itself sees the login happen and keeps the
authorization listed under Settings → Applications; and the imported profile
is *display-only*: peers get no cryptographic proof that a member really
owns the GitHub name they show (profiles are self-asserted, same as typed
names).

The OAuth app lives in the `limehq` org ("Munkel", device flow enabled,
no client secret, since none is needed). To point a build at a different OAuth
app: create one, tick **Enable Device Flow**, then either edit
`GitHubConfig.defaultClientID` or run
`defaults write dev.uq.munkel githubClientID <CLIENT_ID>`.

## munkel CLI

```sh
munkel dm sebil "deploy is green"   # notify one person — resolves the name across channels
munkel channels                     # ● blue-table-42  —  Alex, Sam
munkel blue-table-42 Alex hey       # channel-scoped direct delivery (disambiguates a name)
munkel blue-table-42 all "coffee?"  # channel broadcast
munkel blue-table-42 image ./pic.png ./pic2.png --caption "weekend"  # image album (macOS + Windows)
```

`munkel dm <name> …` is the one-call path: the app resolves `<name>` (display
name or key-id prefix) across every channel, so no `munkel channels` lookup is
needed first. If the name is unknown or matches more than one channel the send
fails with a message naming the candidates, so a single call self-corrects.

The CLI is a thin client: on macOS it talks to the running app over
`~/Library/Application Support/Munkel/control.sock` (newline-delimited
JSON; see `ControlProtocol.swift`, mirrored in `apps/cli/src/munkel.ts`). If
the app isn't running, the CLI launches it in the background (`open -g -b
dev.uq.munkel`) and waits for the socket before sending. The release app also
registers itself as a login item on first launch (toggle under the menu's
gear) so it stays resident and the first send skips cold-start. The
socket path can be overridden via `MUNKEL_SOCKET` (used by the tests).

On Windows the CLI talks to the running app over a named pipe at
`\\.\pipe\Munkel-<user>-Control` (`packages/shared-wire/src/transport.ts`). If the
app is not running, the CLI launches it and waits for the pipe, matching the
macOS auto-launch behavior.

The app resolves channel-code prefixes and recipient display names, and owns all
crypto and relay connections, an ideal substrate for scripting and agent
skills.

### Agent skill

`skills/munkel/SKILL.md` teaches coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, …) to
send Munkel messages through the CLI. Install it with the
[skills CLI](https://skills.sh):

```sh
npx skills add limehq/munkel
```

The skill is send-only by design, like the CLI. (Installing requires the
repo to be public.)

Only `skills/` is published this way. Contributor-only skills live under
`.claude/skills/` — which the `skills` CLI also scans — and set
`metadata.internal: true` in their frontmatter so `npx skills add` skips them.

## Testing without a second Mac

`apps/server/scripts/dev-send.ts` acts as a second channel member: it
implements the full protocol derivation + AES-GCM encryption in TypeScript
independently of MunkelKit, so a message it sends arriving in the notch also
proves Swift↔TS crypto interop (the derivation is additionally pinned in
`CryptoTests.swift`):

```sh
bunx turbo dev --filter=@munkel/server             # relay
cd apps/server
bun scripts/dev-send.ts blue-table-42 Alex "coffee?"
```
